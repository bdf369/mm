- reworked message_t so netdata and working data cells are seperate.
  generates much better code for those parts that don't need network
  order.

- added nPak interface and nPak{C,P} for accessing base cells.

- added AMEncap interface and AMEncap{C,P} for messing with AM
  encapsulations.

- added nPakQueue to hold packets in queues that use the new encapsulation.
